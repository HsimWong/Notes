This is a Ruby simulation of the distributed timestamp algorithm
described in the paper "Synchronous data collection from diverse
hardware" by Camille Goudeseune and Braden Kowitz, available at
http://zx81.isl.uiuc.edu/camilleg/dsceu04.pdf

Type "make" to run the simulation and generate a plot.
The simulation needs Ruby 1.8.1.
The plotting needs gnuplot 3.7, though you could also use
a spreadsheet's charting tools on the textfile plot.dat.

To alter constants of the simulation, edit simulation.rb.
